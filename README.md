## Introduction
After completing the "Junior Frontend Developer" coding bootcamp course at [Coding Front] (https://codingfront.dev) school, this website was made as a project.
This bootcamp had three main sections, for which a project was done after passing each section.
In the first part, after learning HTML and CSS, I tried to develop a similar site (ton.org) as the first project.
In the second part, by learning javascript, I tried to develop a similar site (coincap.io) as a second project.
In the third and final part of the course, I designed and developed this site by learning React.

To do this project, we have to design and then develop a movie database based on the data provided by the APIs of the following site:

  [TMDB API] 
  (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)

On this site, you can find various information and data about movies and TV shows, different genres, their overviews, and various other things.

## The process of completing the project
To design this website, my two main references were the following sites:
(https://30nama.com)
(https://zfilm.life)

After that, I tried to give it a unique identity by choosing a name for the website, as well as finalizing the desired color palette and finally designing the logo.
In the design of the home page, except for the header and footer section, which are repeated in all pages, we have two main sections.
The HeroTrending page where the Trending videos are animated in one section and the site introduction and search section are welcomed in the other section. Because searching and knowing about the most popular movies is one of the basic needs of a movie website.
In the search section, after typing the search item, you will be transferred to a page where, in addition to viewing the search results, you can perform the search again if necessary.
In the second part, movies and TV shows are categorized in a slider. The classification is done as follows:
*Popular Movies
*Popular TVs
*Latest Movies
*On Air TVs
*Top Rated Movies
*Top Rated TVs

In each of the categories, the image of each film is placed in a circle along with the name and year of production of the film below it. By moving the mouse on each circular card, the image is displayed as a rectangle in an elongated rectangular space, and below the image, you can see the information of that movie or TV show, such as the film overview, film rating, and the main genres of the films.
By clicking on each card (as well as on the HeroTrending page on each video image), you will be transferred to the dedicated page of each one.
On that page, you can access the original poster and description of the movie, duration, score, trailer, actors of the movie and also movies similar to the same film.
After that, by clicking on each actor, we will go to a page where the actor's information and filmography can be seen.
In the header section, in addition to the site logo and advanced search by genre, there is a button that can lighten and darken the color theme of the site according to the interest of the audience.
In the footer section, in addition to placing the ways of contact with me, you can see the address of the APIs used and also get brief information about the project in a modal.
